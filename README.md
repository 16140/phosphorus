Compiles Scratch projects into JavaScript and runs them. http://phosphorus.herokuapp.com/

__Note:__ The proxy has some issues when running on Heroku. If your project fails to load (the loading bar turns red) and the console mentions __502 Bad Gateway__, clone the repository and run it on a local PHP server.
